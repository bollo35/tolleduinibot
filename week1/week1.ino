//Description: This program acts as a brief introduction
//  to arduino sketches and other programming facts

//Lines starting with `//` are comments
/*  
    This is a special comment style that
    can take up multiple lines and is commonly
    used to write instructions of some sort
*/   

// notice that `/*` opens the comment and `*/` closes it
    
/*  
    All your startup code goes here and only runs one time
    All your setup code for pins and timers and communication
    should go in this `block` of code

        Set pin mode with the following commands:

        pinMode( <pin number> , <pin status>);
        digitalWrite( <pin number> , <pin status>);
